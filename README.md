### NodeFlair test UI
This is the frontend done up by me trying to re-create the various web components of a job listing page on nodeflair for their technical test.

## Process
I used Functional components in React to build the various UI elements and styled them up with corresponding CSS files.
Data was hardcoded and retrieved from a data file.

## Website
The website is live [here](https://vercel.com/wasjoe1/node-flair-tech-test/8KGaYiDrbMbMCaQgFp3uk86fhrNE)
