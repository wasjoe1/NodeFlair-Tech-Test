### NodeFlair test UI
This is the frontend done up by me trying to re-create the various web components of a job listing page on nodeflair for their technical test.
(to be frank, not the best UI and more can be done...)

## Process
I used Functional components in React to build the various UI elements and styled them up with corresponding CSS files.
Data was hardcoded and retrieved from a data file.

## Website
The website is live [here](https://node-flair-tech-test-aqr0zop1s-wasjoe1.vercel.app/)
